# ntc-app-terraform-w10
At work we have couple engineers running teraform codes locally 
after making changes to the tf file . The goal is to set up some types of automations to 
help run those commands
Since we are using github actions already , do some research how we cans execute those terraform commands through a ci/cd pipeline
also check if there are some terraform scanning tool thant can be integrated in the pipeline
